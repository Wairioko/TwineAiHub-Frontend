3. Refund Eligibility
3.1 EU Customers
Under the EU Consumer Rights Directive, you have a legal right to withdraw from a digital services contract within 14 days of purchase. However, this right is waived if:

You agree to immediate service activation upon purchase.
The service has already been delivered in full during this period.
3.2 US Customers
Refund rights for US customers depend on federal and state laws. In states like California, customers are entitled to additional protections for online purchases, including clearer disclosure of recurring charges.

3.3 Situations Where Refunds May Be Issued
Refunds will be granted in the following scenarios:

Technical Issues: If you are unable to access the service due to a technical fault attributable to Twine AI Hub that remains unresolved for 7 business days.

4. Cooling-Off Period (EU Customers)

The service not being fully consumed during the 14 days.
No explicit consent being given to waive this right during service activation.
5. Subscription Renewals and Cancellations
